# GenAI Chatbot for Giving.sg
This chatbot aims to improve navigation of the Giving.sg website.

This is a practice chatbot. All databases used in this bot are either public or fictional.

### The two main features are:
- providing instant answers to common questions, based on giving.sg FAQ
- suggests campaigns that are most similar to user's interest
G
iving.sg does not provide public access to their API, hence a fake database will be used. Because of this, the accuracy of the bot is limited due to the smaller and less detailed database.

## Competitor: AI from Give.Asia
